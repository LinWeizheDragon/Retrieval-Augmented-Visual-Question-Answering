## Benchmark Results for FLMR in this codebase
Using the provided codebase, it is expected to obtain the following results.

| Model  | Recall@5 | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| FLMR (9 ROIs) | 89.20     |       |
| FLMR (9 ROIs) | 89.28     |  Using the pretrained ckpt     |

| Model  | VQA Score | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| RA-VQA | 54.51     | In the previous paper     |
| RA-VQA-v2 | 61.86     | with FLMR     |

Since we refactored the codebase significantly in clean-up, these numbers may not match exactly to what were reported in the paper.

# Detailed Instructions

## Overview
The framework was designed and implemented by Weizhe Lin, University of Cambridge. All rights are reserved. Use with research purposes is allowed. This framework is designed for **research purpose**, with flexibility for extension. It is not a perfect framework for production, of course.

The training and testing are backboned by pytorch-lightning. The pre-trained Transformer models are from Huggingface-transformers. The training platform is Pytorch.

In this release, we designed a new framework that wraps the data processing/training/testing utilities - [Runway For ML](https://github.com/EriChen0615/runway_for_ml/tree/kbvqa_dev). It is a highly efficient framework that enables flexible experimentation and data processing. Data processing is formulated as a Directional Acyclic Graph, on which the framework traverses through nodes to prepare data. This framework enables efficient data processing at million scale. For more details, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/EriChen0615/runway_for_ml/tree/kbvqa_dev) of the framework. 
When cloning this repository, please use the `kbvqa_dev` branch.

The indexing and searching of FLMR is supported by [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) and [ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT). The ColBERT engine is plugged into this project as a third-party package. We fixed many errors in this package following [LI-RAGE](https://github.com/amazon-science/robust-tableqa).

### Structure
The framework consists of:

1. **main.py**: the main program. It loads a config file and override some entries with command-line arguments. It initialises a `RunwayExperiment` instance to execute training and testing.
2. **Data Ops**: it loads the data according to configs specified in `data_pipeline`. The details of this feature can be found in [here](https://github.com/EriChen0615/runway_for_ml/tree/kbvqa_dev?tab=readme-ov-file#data-preprocessing-1)
3. **Datasets**: they are automatically loaded by the data loader wrapper. `.collate_fn` is defined to collate the data. An decorator class `ModuleParser` is used to help generate the training inputs. This decorator class generates input dict according to configs (`config.model_config.input_modules/decorder_input_modules/output_modules`).
4. **Model Executors**: a pytorch-lightning `LightningModule` instance. It defines training/testing behaviors (training steps, optimizers, schedulers, logging, checkpointing, and so on). It initialises the model being trained at `self.model`.
5. **Models**: pytorch `nn.Modules` models.

### Configs
The configuration is achieved with `jsonnet`. It enables inheritance of config files. For example, `configs/okvqa/FLMR_with_ROI.jsonnet` override its configs to `configs/okvqa/FLMR_base_preload_vision_features.jsonnet`.

By including the corresponding key:value pair in the config file, overriding can be easily performed.

### ModuleParser
A decorator class that helps to parse data into features that are used by models.

An example is shown below:
```
"input_modules": {
    "module_list":[
    {"type": "QuestionInput",  "option": "default", 
                "separation_tokens": {'start': '<BOQ>', 'end': '<EOQ>'}},  
    {"type": "TextBasedVisionInput",  "option": "caption",
                "separation_tokens": {'start': '<BOC>', 'end': '<EOC>'}},
    {"type": "TextBasedVisionInput",  "option": "object", 
                "object_max": 40, "attribute_max": 3, "attribute_thres":0.05, "ocr": 1,
                "separation_tokens": {'start': '<BOV>', 'sep': '<SOV>', 'end': '<EOV>'}},
    ],
    "postprocess_module_list": [
    {"type": "PostProcessInputTokenization", "option": "default"},
    ],
},
"decoder_input_modules": {
    "module_list":[],
    "postprocess_module_list": [],
},
"output_modules": {
    "module_list":[
    {"type": "GenerationOutput", "option": "default"},
    ],
    "postprocess_module_list": [
    {"type": "PostProcessOutputTokenization", "option": "default"},
    ],
},
```
which first generates text_sequences:
```
<BOQ> Question <EOQ> <BOC> Caption <EOC> <BOV> obj1 attr1 attr2 <SOV> obj2 ... [OCR results] <EOV>
```
in the order defined in `input_modules`, and then the postprocessing unit `PostProcessInputTokenization` is used to tokenize the input into `input_ids` and `input_attention_masks`.

By defining new functions in `ModuleParser`, e.g. `self.TextBasedVisionInput`, a new behavior can be easily introduced to transform modules into training features.

### MetricsProcessor
The following entries in config file `test.metrics` define the metrics to compute in validation and testing. Each module uploads `log_dict` with `metrics_name: metrics_value` which can be processed in trainers conveniently.
```
"metrics": [
    {'name': 'compute_exact_match'},
    {'name': 'compute_retrieval_metrics'},
    {'name': 'compute_okvqa_scores'},
],
```

### WANDB Logging
We use WANDB for logging in this framework. You will need to register a WANDB account, and change the WANDB config in `meta_configs/hpc_meta_config.libsonnet`:
```
  "WANDB": {
    "CACHE_DIR":  wandb_cache_dir,
    "entity": "your account/project account",
    "project": "your project",
    "tags": ["FVQA"], // default tags
  },
```


### Useful Command-line Arguments
Some general cli arguments. For more details, please read the code / directly look at how they are used in training/evaluation of specific models.

#### Universal
- All trainer parameters supported by pytorch-lightning, such as :
```
--opts train.trainer_paras.accelerator=auto \
             train.trainer_paras.devices=auto \
             train.trainer_paras.strategy=ddp_find_unused_parameters_true \
             train.trainer_paras.num_sanity_val_steps=2 \
             train.trainer_paras.max_epochs=10000 \
             train.trainer_paras.val_check_interval=1000 \
             train.trainer_paras.accumulate_grad_batches=2 \
```
- `--experiment_name EXPERIMENT_NAME` the name of the experiment. Will be used as the name of the folder as well as the run name on WANDB
- `--mode [prepare_data/train/test]` indicate the mode for running. prepare_data only runs the data preprocessing pipeline.
- `--modules module1 module2 module3 ...` list of modules that will be used. They will be saved to `self.config.model_config.modules` so that they are accessible anywhere in the framework.
- `--log_prediction_tables`: logs validation/test model outputs to WANDB.
- `--tags tag_a tag_b tag_c`: adds tags to the WANDB run.

#### Training

- `--opts [list of configurations]` used at the end of the cli command. `self.config` will be overwritten by the configurations here. For example:

  - `train.batch_size=30` batch size
  - `train.optimizer_config.scheduler=linear` currently supports none/linear
  - `train.trainer_paras.max_epochs=10000`
  - `train.optimizer_config.optimizer_params.lr=0.00001` learning rate
  - `train.trainer_paras.accumulate_grad_batches=2` 
  - `train.optimizer_config.scheduler_params.num_warmup_steps=0`
  - `train.early_stopping_callback_paras.patience=10`
  - `train.model_checkpoint_callback_paras.save_top_k=1` how many best checkpoints are saved
  - `valid.batch_size=4`
  - `train.trainer_paras.val_check_interval=1000` how many steps between validation

#### Testing

- `--test_suffix XXX` this will creates a folder under the experiment folder (indicated by `--experiment_name`) and save everything there. Also, in the WANDB run (run name indicated by `--experiment_name`), a new section with this name (`XXX`) will be created, and the evaluation scores will be logged into this section.
- `--opts test.batch_size=16` 
- `--opts test.load_epoch=6` which checkpoint to load. Note that you need to have the same experiment name

## ElasticSearch
To speed up training and inference, this codebase supports pre-computing image features (including ROI features). These features can be overwhelming if saved to the local disk as individual files. Thus, we install ElasticSearch to index all images and their extracted features.

1. Download [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and unzip

2. Run ElasticSearch at a separate thread and keep it running in the background:
```
./bin/elasticsearch
```

3. In the first launch, note down the password

4. Before running data processing scripts, set the environment variables:
```
export ELASTIC_CA_CERTS="/path/to/elasticsearch-8.7.0/config/certs/http_ca.crt"
export ELASTIC_PASSWORD="YOUR PASSWORD"
```

Data can be saved to `data/ok-vqa/pre-extracted_features/passages/okvqa_full_corpus.csv`.



## Feature Extraction
We provide the pre-extracted features for OK-VQA dataset. If you want to re-extract the features or extract features for other datasets, please follow the instructions below.
### VinVL Features (object detection/attributes/relations)
#### Step 1: Install environments
VinVL needs a separate env.

Refer to [Offical installation guide](https://github.com/microsoft/scene_graph_benchmark/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

Since HPC uses A-100, which requires a higher version of CUDA, the recommended environment with CUDA 10.1 does not work.

```
conda create --name sg_benchmark python=3.7 -y
conda activate sg_benchmark
pip install torch==1.7.1+cu110 torchvision==0.8.2+cu110 torchaudio==0.7.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
conda install ipython h5py nltk joblib jupyter pandas scipy -y
pip install ninja yacs>=0.1.8 cython matplotlib tqdm opencv-python numpy>=1.19.5 
python -m pip install cityscapesscripts
pip install pycocotools scikit-image timm einops
cd materials/scene_graph_benchmark
python setup.py build develop
```


#### Step 2: Generating OKVQA datasets
```
cd materials/scene_graph_benchmark
python tools/prepare_data_for_okvqa.py
```
This command generates trainset/testset of OKVQA datasets to `datasets/okvqa/`, which will be used in object detection.

#### Step 3: Download pre-trained models
```
mkdir models
mkdir models/vinvl
/path/to/azcopy copy https://penzhanwu2.blob.core.windows.net/sgg/sgg_benchmark/vinvl_model_zoo/vinvl_vg_x152c4.pth ./models/vinvl/
```

#### Step 4: Running models
`vinvl_vg_x152c4` is a pre-trained model with object and attribute detection:
For OKVQA dataset:
```
python tools/test_sg_net.py \
    --config-file sgg_configs/vgattr/vinvl_x152c4_okvqa_testset.yaml  \
    TEST.IMS_PER_BATCH 8  \
    MODEL.WEIGHT models/vinvl/vinvl_vg_x152c4.pth  \
    MODEL.ROI_HEADS.NMS_FILTER 1  \
    MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH 0.2  \
    DATA_DIR "./datasets/"  \
    TEST.IGNORE_BOX_REGRESSION True  \
    MODEL.ATTRIBUTE_ON True  \
    TEST.OUTPUT_FEATURE True
```
```
python tools/test_sg_net.py  \
    --config-file sgg_configs/vgattr/vinvl_x152c4_okvqa_trainset.yaml  \
    TEST.IMS_PER_BATCH 8  \
    MODEL.WEIGHT models/vinvl/vinvl_vg_x152c4.pth  \
    MODEL.ROI_HEADS.NMS_FILTER 1  \
    MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH 0.2  \
    DATA_DIR "./datasets/"  \
    TEST.IGNORE_BOX_REGRESSION True  \
    MODEL.ATTRIBUTE_ON True  \
    TEST.OUTPUT_FEATURE True
```

`vinvl_large` is a pre-trained model with **only** object detection. But it was pre-trained on more object detection datasets!
```
python tools/test_sg_net.py  \
    --config-file sgg_configs/vgattr/vinvl_large_okvqa_testset.yaml  \
    TEST.IMS_PER_BATCH 8  \
    MODEL.WEIGHT models/vinvl/vinvl_large.pth  \
    MODEL.ROI_HEADS.NMS_FILTER 1  \
    MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH 0.2  \
    DATA_DIR "./datasets/"  \
    TEST.IGNORE_BOX_REGRESSION True  \
    MODEL.ATTRIBUTE_ON True  \
    TEST.OUTPUT_FEATURE True
```
```
python tools/test_sg_net.py  \
    --config-file sgg_configs/vgattr/vinvl_large_okvqa_trainset.yaml  \
    TEST.IMS_PER_BATCH 8  \
    MODEL.WEIGHT models/vinvl/vinvl_large.pth  \
    MODEL.ROI_HEADS.NMS_FILTER 1  \
    MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH 0.2  \
    DATA_DIR "./datasets/"  \
    TEST.IGNORE_BOX_REGRESSION True  \
    MODEL.ATTRIBUTE_ON True  \
    TEST.OUTPUT_FEATURE True
```

#### Step 5: Recommended Save Path
The object/attribute data can be saved to `data/ok-vqa/pre-extracted_features/vinvl_output/vinvl_okvqa_trainset_full/inference/vinvl_vg_x152c4/predictions.tsv`.

### Oscar+ Features (image captioning)
#### Step 1: Download data
We can download COCO-caption data with azcopy:
```
cd materials/Oscar
path/to/azcopy copy 'https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/datasets/coco_caption' ./oscar_dataset --recursive
```
Reference: [offical download page](https://github.com/microsoft/Oscar/blob/master/VinVL_DOWNLOAD.md)

#### Step 2: Download the pre-trained model
We can download [COCO captioning large](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/model_ckpts/image_captioning/coco_captioning_large_scst.zip) here, or refer to the [official download page](https://github.com/microsoft/Oscar/blob/master/VinVL_MODEL_ZOO.md#Image-Captioning-on-COCO) for the model checkpoints.

Save the pre-trained model to `pretrained_models/coco_captioning_large_scst`.

#### Step 3: Running the inference
```
python oscar/run_captioning.py \
    --do_test \
    --do_eval \
    --test_yaml oscar_dataset/coco_caption/[train/val/test].yaml \
    --per_gpu_eval_batch_size 64 \
    --num_beams 5 \
    --max_gen_length 20 \
    --output_prediction_path './output/[train/val/test]_predictions.json' \
    --eval_model_dir pretrained_models/coco_captioning_large_scst/checkpoint-4-50000
```

Note that in the script, `transformer` is renamed to `transformer2` such that it won't conflict with existing `transformer` package in your environment.

#### Step 4: Recommended Save Path
The data can be saved to `data\ok-vqa\pre-extracted_features\captions\train_predictions.json`.


### Google OCR Features
First, enable Google OCR APIs; download the key file to `google_ocr_key.json`. This is **not** free! Ask me for the already generated features.
```
cd src
python ocr.py
```
The detected features will be saved to `data/ok-vqa/pre-extracted_features/OCR`.

## Fine-grained Late-interaction Multi-modal Retrieval
**IMPORTANT NOTE**: In the following sections, first you need to run the provided scripts with `--mode train` changed to `--mode prepare_data`. This runs the data preprocessing and save the processing results to the cache folder. Then, you will be able to reuse these cache files in later runs. If you want to re-run some of the data nodes, open the data config file (e.g. `configs/okvqa/okvqa_data_config.libsonnet`) and change `regenerate=False` to `True`, and then rerun the script with `--mode prepare_data`. You will see that the nodes with `regenerate=True`, along with their downstream nodes,  are re-generated.

### Pretraining the mapping network with WIT

```
python src/main.py \
    --experiment_name "FLMR_Pretraining(WIT)_MappingNetwork(32)" \
    --config "configs/wit/FLMR_WIT_pretraining.jsonnet" \
    --reset --override \
    --mode train \
    --opts train.trainer_paras.accelerator=auto \
             train.trainer_paras.devices=auto \
             train.trainer_paras.strategy=ddp_find_unused_parameters_true \
             train.trainer_paras.num_sanity_val_steps=2 \
             train.trainer_paras.max_epochs=10000 \
             train.batch_size=30 \
             train.trainer_paras.val_check_interval=1000 \
             valid.batch_size=16 \
             train.trainer_paras.accumulate_grad_batches=2 \
             train.early_stopping_callback_paras.patience=10 \
             train.optimizer_config.optimizer_params.lr=0.00001 \
             train.optimizer_config.scheduler=none \
```
A pretrained checkpoint is provided earlier in this document. You don't have to run the pretraining on your own.

### Finetuning FLMR on the GoogleSearch corpus
```
python src/main.py \
    --experiment_name "OKVQA_FLMR_9ROI_with_text_based_vision_fix_lens" \
    --config "configs/okvqa/FLMR_with_ROI.jsonnet" \
    --reset --override \
    --mode train \
    --opts train.trainer_paras.accelerator=auto \
             train.trainer_paras.devices=auto \
             train.trainer_paras.strategy=ddp_find_unused_parameters_true \
             train.trainer_paras.num_sanity_val_steps=2 \
             train.trainer_paras.max_epochs=10000 \
             train.batch_size=30 \
             train.trainer_paras.val_check_interval=1000 \
             valid.batch_size=16 \
             train.trainer_paras.accumulate_grad_batches=2 \
             train.early_stopping_callback_paras.patience=10 \
             train.optimizer_config.optimizer_params.lr=0.00001 \
             train.optimizer_config.scheduler=none \
             model_config.num_ROIs=9 \
             train.load_model_path="checkpoint_path" \
```
`checkpoint_path` is the path to either the checkpoint saved during the pretraining in the previous step, or the pretrained checkpoint `WIT_pretrained_ckpt.ckpt`.


### Generating static retrieval results for inspection and inference
```
python src/main.py \
    --experiment_name "OKVQA_FLMR_9ROI_with_text_based_vision_generate_index" \
    --config "configs/okvqa/FLMR_with_ROI.jsonnet" \
    --reset --override \
    --test_suffix generate_index \
    --mode test \
    --opts test.trainer_paras.accelerator=auto \
             test.trainer_paras.devices=auto \
             test.trainer_paras.strategy=ddp_find_unused_parameters_true \
             test.batch_size=16 \
             model_config.num_ROIs=10 \
             train.load_model_path="checkpoitn_path" \
             data_pipeline.transforms.input:LoadGoogleSearchAnnotations.setup_kwargs.use_all_samples=1 \
```
## BLIP2 with FLMR
The static results are generated in the previous step:
```
"/path/to/experiments/OKVQA_FLMR_9ROI_with_text_based_vision_generate_index/test/generate_index/generate_index_test_OKVQADatasetForDPR.test_predictions_rank_0.json",
"/path/to/experiments/OKVQA_FLMR_9ROI_with_text_based_vision_generate_index/test/generate_index/generate_index_test_OKVQADatasetForDPR.train_predictions_rank_0.json",
```
Change the config file `configs/rag/okvqa/RAG_BLIP2_with_FLMR.jsonnet`
```
local index_files = {
  "index_path": "",
  "embedding_path": "",
  "static_results": [
    "/path/to/experiments/OKVQA_FLMR_9ROI_with_text_based_vision_generate_index/test/generate_index/generate_index_test_OKVQADatasetForDPR.test_predictions_rank_0.json",
    "/path/to/experiments/OKVQA_FLMR_9ROI_with_text_based_vision_generate_index/test/generate_index/generate_index_test_OKVQADatasetForDPR.train_predictions_rank_0.json",
  ],
};
```
Note: this framework also supports retrieving passages dynamically. Due to time constraints, we are not able to provide a hit-to-run instruction for that feature. Users are encouraged to explore this feature if they are interested in using RAVQA-v2 with joint training (similar to RAVQA-v1).


Now you can run training as follows:
```
python src/main.py \
    --experiment_name "OKVQA_RAG_BLIP2(t5-xl)_FLMR(10ROI)" \
    --config "configs/rag/okvqa/RAG_BLIP2_with_FLMR.jsonnet" \
    --modules static_retrieval force_existence \
    --reset --override \
    --mode train \
    --opts train.trainer_paras.accelerator=auto \
             train.trainer_paras.devices=auto \
             train.trainer_paras.strategy=ddp_find_unused_parameters_true \
             train.trainer_paras.num_sanity_val_steps=2 \
             train.trainer_paras.max_epochs=9999999 \
             train.trainer_paras.precision="bf16" \
             train.batch_size=1 \
             train.trainer_paras.val_check_interval=500 \
             valid.batch_size=16 \
             train.trainer_paras.accumulate_grad_batches=16 \
             train.early_stopping_callback_paras.patience=5 \
             train.optimizer_config.optimizer_params.lr=0.0001 \
             train.optimizer_config.scheduler=none \
             train.model_checkpoint_callback_paras.save_top_k=1 \
             model_config.num_beams=2 \
             model_config.num_knowledge_passages=5 \
             model_config.num_knowledge_passages_in_training=5 \
```
If you encounter GPU OOM errors, try reducing `num_knowledge_passages_in_training` to reduce the passages used in each forward pass. If `num_knowledge_passages_in_training < num_knowledge_passages (K)`, random passages will be drawn from top-K retrieved documents.


# Some Notes
- This publication version was made in a rush due to intensive workload that the author currently have. We will add follow-up patches to make codes more readible and ensure reproducibility. (of course, the speed depends on the number of people who are interested in using this framework.)
- Before applying the system to your own task, you may find it useful to read the author's note in `third_party/ColBERT/colbert/search/index_storage.py: Line 67`.

M2KR contains a collection of vision and language tasks which we have incorporated into a single suite of benchmark tasks for training and evaluating general-purpose multi-modal retrievers. We use M2KR to develop PreFLMR, a pre-trained version of the recently developed Fine-grained Late-interaction Multi-modal Retriever (FLMR) approach to KB-VQA, and we report new state-of-the-art results across a range of tasks. We also present investigations into the scaling behaviors of PreFLMR intended to be useful in future developments in general-purpose multi-modal retrievers.",

Recent OK-VQA systems use Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) to retrieve documents from external knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia, but with DPR trained separately from answer generation, introducing a potential limit on the overall system performance. Instead, we propose a joint training scheme which includes differentiable DPR integrated with answer generation so that the system can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Our experiments show that our scheme outperforms recent OK-VQA systems with strong DPR for retrieval. We also introduce new diagnostic metrics to analyze how retrieval and generation interact. The strong retrieval ability of our model significantly reduces the number of retrieved documents needed in training, yielding significant benefits in answer quality and computation required for training.",
